# Face-Recognition-System
A Facial Recognition System is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. There are multiple methods in which facial recognition systems work. This project is carried out via Open-CV python version 3. I hope you guys will find this project helpful. Feel free to comment if you find any bugs in the code. Thank you.
